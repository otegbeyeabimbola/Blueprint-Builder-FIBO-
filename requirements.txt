### Why these packages?

  * **`pydantic`**: You mentioned "bulletproof schema validation." Pydantic V2 is the industry standard for this. It allows you to define the **Bond** or **Financial Asset** models strict types.
  * **`typer`**: This is the modern standard for Python CLIs. It lets you build the `blueprint build --input ...` commands effortlessly.
  * **`rich`**: This is the secret weapon for your "Enhanced Interface." It allows you to render the **Audit Ledger** as a beautiful table in the terminal, display the **Cryptographic Badge** icons, and show color-coded **diffs** (changes) between the broken AI output and the fixed version.
  * **`python-dateutil`**: AI often hallucinates date formats (e.g., "Dec 1st 25" vs "2025-12-01"). This library helps your "Deterministic Patcher" normalize them automatically.
